# Thoughts about the perfect cuboid.

The unsolved problem of whether a perfect cuboid exists or not,
or whether there is a proof pro or contra its existence...
See for example http://unsolvedproblems.org/index_files/PerfectCuboid.htm

I believe to have a simple proof using logic and *Reductio ad absurdum*
for the assumption that there is a smallest solution.
